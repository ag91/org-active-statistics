This is a simple add-on for org mode. I found it wasteful to close tasks
(i.e., marking heading as DONE) when all my sub-headings or check-boxes
are marked completed themselves.

One way to use is to copy the file into your preferred directory and
use the marvellous [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package.el]] like follows:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-active-statistics
  :after org
  :commands org-toggle-active-statistics
  :load-path "path-to-your-directory"
  :config
    (org-toggle-active-statistics))
#+end_src
